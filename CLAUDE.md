# CLAUDE.md — working conventions for kherveDOC

Project: WYSIWYG editor that produces LaTeX and tracks changes in Git.
Stack: Python 3.12+, PySide6, tectonic (LaTeX engine), PyMuPDF, pygit2.
Remote: https://github.com/gkerherve/kherveTeX

## Branching: `dev` is the working branch

**All my work goes on `dev` in the main repo checkout.** I do not commit
to `main` directly. `main` is the stable mainline that lags behind `dev`
until the user explicitly asks for a merge.

**Never work in a git worktree (e.g. `.claude/worktrees/...`) or on a
throwaway branch like `claude/<name>`.** The user watches commits land
on `dev` in PyCharm's Git Log; commits made on worktree branches do not
show up there. If I find myself in a worktree or on a non-`dev` branch,
switch to the main repo path
(`C:\Users\gwilh\OneDrive - Imperial College London\Documents\MEGAsync\Programs\Python\kherveDOC`)
and `git checkout dev` before editing anything.

Workflow:
1. Confirm I am in the main repo (not a worktree) and on `dev`
   (`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` → `dev`,
   `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` → the main repo path above). If not,
   `cd` to the main repo and `git checkout dev`.
2. If `dev` doesn't exist locally, create it from `main`:
   `git checkout -b dev origin/dev` (or branch from `origin/main` and
   push with `-u origin dev`).
3. Make the edits.
4. Run `py -m pytest tests/ -q` and verify all tests pass.
5. `git add` the specific files I changed (avoid bare `git add -A` —
   it has already once swept in `.idea/` IDE configs).
6. `git commit` with a HEREDOC-formatted message explaining the **why**,
   not the what — the diff already shows what changed.
7. `git push` — **never skip this step**. If the push fails (no network,
   auth), report it but do not retry destructively.

If the user explicitly asks for a merge into `main`, do it as a single
fast-forward or merge commit on `main`, push, then return to `dev`.

## Always commit and push after any change

After every code change, commit and push to `origin/dev` without being
asked. Never leave changes uncommitted at the end of a turn. This rule
holds even for small edits — README updates, comment fixes, one-line
bug fixes.

## Bump the version when behaviour changes

`khervedoc/__init__.py` defines `__version__` as `"<major>.<minor>"` only
(e.g. `"0.5"`). The window title renders it as

> `kherveDOC v<major>.<minor>.<commit_count>+<sha7> — <filename>`

The patch component is the total commit count and the `+<sha7>` build
tag are appended automatically from `pygit2` at startup — they update
every commit on their own. **Never put a third number in `__version__`.**

Bump the **minor** (`"0.5" → "0.6"`) when there is **any** change to
user-visible behaviour. This includes:

- New features (tab, toolbar group, menu entry, model node type).
- Bug fixes that change what the user sees or what the compiler
  produces (crash fixes, output changes, format fixes).
- Changes to serializers, importers, or compilers that alter the
  generated LaTeX / Typst / PDF output.

The only commits that do **not** bump are pure internal refactors,
documentation / comment edits, and test-only changes — i.e. commits
where the user cannot tell anything changed. **When in doubt, bump.**

Bump the **major** (`"0.x" → "1.0"`) only at the user's explicit
request.

Bump `__version__` in the **same commit** as the change that justifies
it.

## Architectural invariants

- Comments only when the *why* is non-obvious; never narrate the *what*.
- The **document model** (`khervedoc/model.py`) is the single source of
  truth. The editor, serializer, importers and git layer all read/write
  through it. Never edit LaTeX strings directly outside `serializer.py`.
- Tests in `tests/` cover model + serializer + importer. Any change to
  those modules must come with matching tests in the **same commit**.
- Toolbar icons are drawn at runtime in `icons.py` with QPainter — do
  not ship PNG/SVG files.
- The light Fusion palette in `__main__.py` is intentional; do not
  remove it (the Windows dark theme made the icons invisible).
- Auto-commits from the app (`git_backend.py`) read the user's git
  identity from their git config so they look identical to CLI commits
  — do not regress that.

## Building a release: tectonic and its package cache are REQUIRED

Every installer (Windows and macOS) must ship **both** the tectonic binary
and a warmed tectonic package cache. Without the cache, a brand-new PC
starts with an empty tectonic cache: every compile has to go online, a
slow or filtered network fails with "Offline, and … not in the local TeX
cache yet", and a missing font prints blank text. That is what broke the
Windows 0.214 installs.

- `KherveTeX.spec` enforces it: it fetches the pinned tectonic release
  into `packaging/bin/` (`packaging/fetch_tectonic.py`, `TECTONIC_VERSION`),
  builds `khervedoc/tectonic_cache/` with `fetch_tectonic.warm()` when it is
  missing, and **stops the build** if the cache has fewer than 500 files.
  Never weaken that back into a warning, and never bundle `~/bin/tectonic`
  or a Homebrew tectonic — the cache must come from the binary that ships.
- To rebuild the cache by hand (e.g. after adding a template or a
  package): `python packaging/fetch_tectonic.py --warm`. It runs
  `compiler.download_tectonic_bundle` (every document class, a
  kitchen-sink package document, and 10/11/12 pt font-coverage documents:
  headings, bold/italic/sans/typewriter, `\url`, footnotes, math) and every
  starter example, then copies tectonic's cache. **Add any new template's
  packages or fonts to `download_tectonic_bundle`.**
- At start-up the frozen app copies the bundled cache into the user's
  tectonic cache (`__main__._seed_tectonic_cache`, missing files only).
- `packaging/smoke_test.py` (CI, Windows and macOS, and on the *installed*
  Windows app) runs the app on an **empty** tectonic cache, checks it is
  seeded, then compiles every example plus a 12 pt two-column `\url`
  document with `--only-cached`. A package or font missing from the
  bundle fails the build instead of a user's compile. Run it on any local
  build before publishing:
  `python packaging/smoke_test.py dist/KherveTeX/KherveTeX.exe`.
- `compiler.compile_tex` is cache-first; a missing file **or font**
  (`_MISSING_FILE_RE`, `_MISSING_FONT_RE`) triggers one online retry with
  a 15-minute limit. Compiler ▸ Compiler status shows the engine, the
  cache and whether a document compiles offline.
- On a Mac with python.org Python, downloads may fail with
  CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED: prefix the command with
  `SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/ssl/cert.pem`.
