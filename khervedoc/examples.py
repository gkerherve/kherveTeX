"""Example documents shown under the Examples menu and used as the
starting document when KherveTeX opens for the first time.

Each factory returns a fully-formed Document so the editor can hand it
straight to set_document(). Keeping the examples here (rather than as
.kdocz files shipped on disk) means they always match the current
model schema — no risk of an example loading with a missing field
after a model bump.

Examples are intentionally long enough to span several PDF pages —
new users see a real document the first time they open the app, not
a stub, and the page-flipping preview is obvious from the first
keystroke.
