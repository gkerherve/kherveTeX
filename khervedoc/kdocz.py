"""Single-file `.kdocz` container — a ZIP holding the document JSON plus
every image the document references.

Layout inside the archive:

    manifest.json   - schema version + producing app
    document.json   - the KherveTeX document model, image paths rewritten
                      to point at the bundled files (e.g. "images/figure_001.png")
    images/         - the bundled image files referenced by Figure nodes

Saving: copies every Figure-referenced file into the archive and rewrites
the in-archive document's paths to those bundled locations, so reopening
the file on another machine still finds the images.

Loading: extracts the archive into a directory (a temp dir by default)
and rewrites the Figure paths to absolute paths under that directory, so
the LaTeX compiler can pick them up via the existing \\includegraphics
machinery.
